## ros2matrix

Ros2 node to send and recieve messages to a matrix bridge.
Matrix bridges the allow to go to messenger apps like whatsapp.
Usefull to build a sort of prompt to the robot.

## 
This is a draft. I am not too familiar with ROS. It is not that I do not use at my job but doing a million things around it, when I come back to
ROS I already forgot a lot.

## Principle

From what I understant, I will specify a ros message to interact with Whatsapp.

I want:

* Send a message from ROS to the messenger app.
* Send from the messenger app to ROS (is the ROBOT a user?).
* Send a multiple choice question from ROS and receive the answer from the user.
* Send a picture.

## Testing

It needs ros installed and a matrix bridge.
Maybe it can be automated by using only a matrix client in a container.
